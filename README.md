| **Plan For Design**   | Initially thought of different game ideas before deciding on a Cup Pong game. |
| **3D Design**         | Easily created the cups, then changed their size through adjustments. Designed a stable platform to support the cups and connected to the Finch robot. |
| **Code Developed**    | Developed a concept that is involved with the Finch robot with my game. Programmed the robot to move to a new position when shaken. |

  The **Design Cycle** had several key stages that was involved in my project:  
  - **Imagine/Plan:** Brainstorming various game concepts to explore different possibilities for the project.
  - **Create/Improve:** Developing an initial model, identifying its flaws, and refining it for a better version. 
  - **Test:** Writing and testing code to ensure the success of the game with the robot, repeatedly debugging and optimizing for smooth functionality.
