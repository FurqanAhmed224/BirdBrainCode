Code Written by: Furqan Ahmed

| **Progress**       | **Check?**          |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Plan for design** | Wanted to do some type of game |
|                    | Decided to do a Cup Pong Game |
| **3D Design**      | Made the cups pretty easily |
|                    | Had to change the size and play around with it |
|                    | Needed some type of platform to hold the cups and connect to the finch |
| **Code Developed** | Built an idea that I could use with the finch and the game |
|                    | Made sure that when the finch is shaken the robot moves to another space |
