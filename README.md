| Plan for design    | wanted to do some type of game |
                     |decided to do a Cup Pong Game |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 3D Design   | Made the cups pretty easily |
              | Had to change the size and play around with it |
              | Needed some type of platform to hold the cups and connect to the finch |
| Code Developed | Built and idea that I could use with the finch and the game      |  
                 | Made sure that when the finch is shaken the robot moves to another space |
