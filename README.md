| Plan for design   | Wanted to do some type of game, decided to do a Cup Pong Game |
| 3D Design         | Made the cups pretty easily, had to change the size and play around with it, needed some type of platform to hold the cups and connect to the finch |
| Code Developed    | Built an idea that I could use with the finch and the game, made sure that when the finch is shaken the robot moves to another space |
