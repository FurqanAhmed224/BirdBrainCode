| **Plan For Design**   |Initially thought of different game ideas before deciding on a Cup Pong game. ✅ |
| **3D Design**         |Easily created the cups, then changed their size through adjustments. Designed a stable platform to support the cups and connected to the Finch robot. ✅ |
| **Code Developed**    |Developed a concept that is involved with the Finch robot with my game. Programmed the robot to move to a new position when shaken. ✅ |

  The **Design Cycle** had several key stages that was involved in my project:  
  - **Imagine/Plan:** Brainstorming various game concepts to explore different possibilities for the project.
  - **Create/Improve:** Developing an initial model, identifying its flaws, and refining it for a better version. 
  - **Test:** Writing and testing code to ensure the success of the game with the robot, repeatedly debugging and optimizing for smooth functionality.

**The Motivation** behind my project is that I wanted to create some type of game that everyone plays and was easy to create and plan out. So, I thought of Cup Pong, a game that everyone plays on there phone against their friends. But, this creation was a bit different because your not swiping on your phone, It's actually been brought to life on a robot with some limitations.

During my time making this project, **I Learned** different types of engines, for example - Tinkercad: a good engine to start your 3D designing, Ecllipse: an actual coding engine that is used by professionals and a good engine to get used to in the industry.

My project has a lot of different factors to it that make it **stand out**. One standout feature of this project is how it brings an online game into the real world, combining it with the finch robot for a better style.
